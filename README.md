# Image_to_Video
Notebook implementation of CVPR 2023 paper "Conditional Image-to-Video Generation with Latent Flow Diffusion Models"

This is a notebook implementation of the CVPR 2023 paper "Conditional Image-to-Video Generation with Latent Flow Diffusion Models", inspired by [CVPR23_LFDM](https://github.com/nihaomiao/CVPR23_LFDM).
Training is done on the [NATOPS dataset](https://github.com/yalesong/natops).

For space and resource constraints, the training is done on only 5 actions from NATOPS data, reduced epochs and smaller batch sizes. Training done on Colab 16GB T4 GPU.
